 * recognition using the `FindChoicesOptions` structure.

 * const choice = {

 * This function is layered above `findValues()` and simply determines all of the synonyms that

 * `recognizeChoices()` function is layered above this function and adds the ability to select a
 * choice by index or ordinal position in the list. Calling this particular function is useful
 * when you don't want the index and ordinal position recognition done by `recognizeChoices()`.
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { findChoices } = require('botbuilder-choices');
 *
 * const choices = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
 * const utterance = context.activity.text;
 * const results = findChoices(utterance, choices);
 * if (results.length == 1) {
 *     await context.sendActivity(`I like ${results[0].resolution.value} too!`);
 * } else if (results.length > 1) {
 *     const ambiguous = results.map((r) => r.resolution.value);
 *     await context.sendActivity(ChoiceFactory.forChannel(context, ambiguous, `Which one?`));
 * } else {
 *     await context.sendActivity(ChoiceFactory.forChannel(context, choices, `I didn't get that... Which color?`));
 * }
 * ```
 * @param utterance The text or user utterance to search over. For an incoming 'message' activity you can simply use `context.activity.text`.
 * @param choices List of choices to search over.
 * @param options (Optional) options used to tweak the search that's performed.
