/**
 * Defines the core behavior of a bot adapter that can connect a bot to a service endpoint.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities to and receives
 * activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an activity, the adapter
 * creates a turn context object, passes it to your bot application logic, and sends responses
 * back to the user's channel.
 *
 * The adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot middleware pipeline to
 * your bot logic and then back out again. As each activity flows in and out of the bot, each
 * piece of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, both before and after the bot logic runs.
 * Use the [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method to add [Middleware](xref:botbuilder-core.Middleware)
 * objects to your adapter's middleware collection.
 *
 * For more information, see the articles on
 * [How bots work](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics) and
 * [Middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-middleware).
