This repository contains code for the JavaScript version of the [Microsoft Bot Builder SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder). The Bot Builder SDK v4 is the latest SDK for building bot applications. It is in **Preview** state and is being actively developed. 
Production bots should continue to be developed using the [v3 SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder/tree/master/Node). 

In addition to the .NET SDK, Bot Builder supports creating bots in other popular programming languages like [.NET](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet), [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-python), and [Java](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java).
