For steps on how to test SSO using the skillParent and skillChild samples, please refer to the [ReadMe for C#](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/blob/main/tests/Skills/ReadMeForSSOTesting.md)
You will need to add your bot specific secrets like appId and password to the .env files instead of the appsettings.json as mentioned the C# ReadMe.
