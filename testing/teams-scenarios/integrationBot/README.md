# Integration Bot

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it is used to exercise features of [Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/) integration.

## Recordings for integration testing.
This bot demonstrates how to perform recordings with Teams for integration testing.  See [background info](https://github.com/daveta/teams/blob/master/README.md) for more information.  

### Recording
See [the prequisites for running this sample](#prerequisites) to completely set up **ngrok**.

Recordings use [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) to capture traffic from the client.  The specific script/scenario used to exercise all the features of this bot are [here](#recording-script)

```bash
# Install
mkdir recordings
npm install

# Set record mode
  # Windows
  set TEST_MODE=RECORD
  # Powershell
  $env:TEST_MODE=RECORD
  # Linux
  export TEST_MODE=RECORD
  
# run the bot
npm start
```
Once the bot is started in record mode, execute the scenario(s) you wish to repeat later.  In this sample, typing ''`exit`" shuts the bot down gracefully.  All the traffic should be captured in the form of .json files in the `recordings` directory.

### Playing recordings locally
To play back the recordings locally, perform the following.
```bash
# Set record mode - true or false
  # Windows
  set TEST_MODE=PLAY
  # Powershell
  $env:TEST_MODE=PLAY
  # Linux
  export TEST_MODE=PLAY

# run the bot
npm start
```
The bot should run through the recording and validate the data is correct.

### Proxy host the recordings 

For other languages such as C#, it's convenient to host the recordings as a pseudo Teams server, and run through the scenarios that were recorded.

To create the proxy host (which acts as the Teams proxy) perform the following:

  > NOTE: The recordings exercise any AuthN paths.
  >
  > NOTE: The proxy by default listens on port 3979/
```
  # Windows
  set TEST_MODE=PROXY_HOST
  set PROXY_HOST=http://localhost:3979 # Or wherever the proxy is running
  # Powershell
  $env:TEST_MODE=PROXY_HOST
  $env:PROXY_HOST=http://localhost:3979 # Or wherever the proxy is running
  # Linux
  export TEST_MODE=PROXY_HOST
  export PROXY_HOST=http://localhost:3979 # Or wherever the proxy is running

# run the bot
npm start
```


In order to trigger the test, the client first must begin recording (`GET /api/runtests`) to start the tests.

### Play recordings against proxy

To use the proxy host, the client must trigger the proxy to begin the calls (see drawing above).

To create the use the proxy host, perform the following:
  > NOTE: The recordings exercise any AuthN paths.
```
  # Windows
  set TEST_MODE=PROXY_PLAY
  # Powershell
  $env:TEST_MODE=PROXY_PLAY
  # Linux
  export TEST_MODE=PROXY_PLAY

# run the bot
npm start
```

## To try this sample

- In a terminal, navigate to bot folder (ie `link-unfurling`).

It's suggested you run the bot twice.  First with recording turned on, second with recording turned off.

```bash
# Install
mkdir recordings
npm install

# Set record mode - true or false
  # Windows
  set AZURE_NOCK_RECORD=true
  # Powershell
  $env:AZURE_NOCK_RECORD="true"

# run the bot
npm start
```

### Interacting with the bot

1. Send a message to your bot in Teams.
2. Type any valid https url, ie https://www.bing.com, wait until the url is bolded, hit the space key and you should see a thumbnail card for the url info populated, like below. 
   ![Sample Unfurl](./_images/1569017810114.png)
3. If recording, as you send messages, you should see new text files in the `./recordings` directory.
4. Type `exit` into the Teams bot if you want the bot to exit.

### Notes
1. Url unfurls are cached.  Try using different https `.com` sites each time.
2. If you install multiple bots which handle link unfurling, the first bot that responds will be displayed.
3. If the bot returns multiple results, the first result will be displayed.
4. Link unfurling action is handled by `onAppBasedLinkQuery` method in the bot code
