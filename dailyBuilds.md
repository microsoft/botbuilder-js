# Consuming daily builds of the SDK

## Using npm
Daily packages for the Bot Framework SDK for JS are published to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) and can be installed by using the `next` tag.

```bash
npm i botbuilder@next botbuilder-dialogs@next
```

## Using MyGet
The Microsoft Bot Framework team maintains a [MyGet Gallery](https://botbuilder.myget.org) which contains feeds for the various SDK languages and other team projects. For JavaScript development, use the [JS daily build feed](https://botbuilder.myget.org/gallery/botbuilder-v4-js-daily). 

To consume the latest daily builds of the Bot Framework SDK via MyGet, you'll need to configure `npm` to use the MyGet feed before installing.

### Configure npm registry

Use the following command to set the npm registry to access the MyGet feed.

- npm config set registry https://botbuilder.myget.org/F/botbuilder-v4-js-daily/npm/

To reset the registry in order to get the latest published version, run:

- npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
